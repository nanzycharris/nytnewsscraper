Mongoose and Cheerio news scrapper app

Whenever a user visits your site, the app scrapes stories from the New York Times website and displays them for the user. Each scraped article can be saved to the application database. The app scrapes and displays the following information for each article:


Headline - the title of the article


Summary - a short summary of the article


URL - the url to the original article


Feel free to add more content to your database (photos, bylines, and so on).


Users are also be able to leave comments on the articles displayed and revisit them later. The comments are saved to the database as well and associated with their articles. Users are also able to delete comments left on articles. All stored comments are visible to every user.

App has been deployed to Heroku.
